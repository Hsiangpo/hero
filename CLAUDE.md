# Project Constitution: "封神挂机录"
# Version: 2.0 (Complete Theme Transition)
# Last Updated: 2025-09-16

## 1. Project Overview
This project creates "封神挂机录" (Fengshen Idle Record), a Chinese mythology-themed idle RPG mini-game for Douyin/WeChat, inspired by the success factors of "咸鱼之王" (Salted Fish King). The core gameplay features 挂机修仙 (idle cultivation), 45 Fengshen characters with 五行羁绊 (five-element bonds), and 封域之争 (Domain Battle) PvP system. This document is the master directive for an entire team of specialized AI agents led by an Orchestrator_Agent.
### 1.1 Project Repository
- **Platform**: GitHub
- **URL**: https://github.com/Hsiangpo/hero

## 2. Core Principles (The Laws of This Project)
1.  **Orchestrator-Worker Model**: The `Orchestrator_Agent` is the sole commander. All tasks are decomposed and delegated by it. Worker agents only execute tasks assigned to them.
2.  **Test-Driven Development (TDD) is Law**: No implementation code is to be written before a corresponding failing test exists. The workflow is strictly: `GDD -> Failing Tests -> Code to Pass Tests -> Refactor`.
3.  **GDD is the Single Source of Truth**: The specifications created by the `Game_Designer_Agent` in the `/specs` directory are the definitive source of truth for any feature. All agents must adhere to it strictly.
4.  **Standardized Communication**: All task delegations from the Orchestrator MUST use the "Authorization Prompt Template" defined in Section 2.1.
5.  **Adherence to Guidelines**: All agents MUST strictly follow the development guidelines and standards outlined in Section 4 of this document.
6.  **Chinese Language Requirement**: ALL agents MUST communicate in Chinese (中文) when creating user-facing documentation, reports, or communications intended for the project owner. This includes but not limited to:
   - Game Design Documents (GDD) - MUST be written in Chinese
   - Status reports and progress updates
   - Error messages and user feedback
   - Documentation intended for project review
   - All communications with the project owner
   - Code comments may remain in English for technical clarity

### 2.1 Authorization Prompt Template
When the `Orchestrator_Agent` delegates tasks to worker agents, it MUST use the following standardized template:

```markdown
# AUTHORIZATION PROMPT FOR [AGENT_NAME]

## TASK DIRECTIVE
[Clear, concise description of the task and its importance to the project]

## 输入资源 (Input Resources)
1. **功能规格说明**: [Path to relevant GDD file]
2. **相关文档**: [List of all relevant documentation files]
3. **特殊要求**: [Any special requirements or constraints]

## 4. Development Guidelines & Standards (MANDATORY)
**Attention all Agents:** You are required to read, understand, and strictly adhere to the following guidelines in all your work. The `Orchestrator_Agent` will enforce these rules during integration, and the `Refactor_And_Review_Agent` will use them as the basis for code reviews.

### 4.1 Coding Style Guide
1.  **Naming Conventions**:
    - Variables and functions: `camelCase` (e.g., `userLevel`, `calculateDamage`)
    - Classes and Components: `PascalCase` (e.g., `HeroPanel`, `CombatService`)
    - Constants: `UPPER_CASE_SNAKE` (e.g., `MAX_LEVEL`)
2.  **Comments**:
    - All public methods and classes MUST have TSDoc-style comments for the `Documentation_Agent`.
    - Complex logic blocks should have a brief, single-line comment explaining the "why".
3.  **Imports**:
    - Group imports: 1. Node modules, 2. Project modules, 3. Relative imports.

### 4.2 API Design Guide
1.  **Endpoint Naming**:
    - Use plural nouns for resources (e.g., `/api/v1/heroes`).
    - Use kebab-case for paths.
2.  **Standard JSON Response**:
    - **Success**: `{ "success": true, "data": { ... } }`
    - **Error**: `{ "success": false, "error": { "code": 1001, "message": "Insufficient funds." } }`
3.  **Authentication**:
    - All requests must include an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header, except for `/login` and `/register`.

### 4.3 Git Workflow Guide
1.  **Branching**:
    - All new features must be developed in a branch named `feature/TASK_ID-brief-description`.
    - Example: `feature/T123-implement-hero-levelup`.
2.  **Pull Requests (PRs)**:
    - Each task completion must be submitted as a PR to the `main` branch.
    - The PR description must link to the GDD specification.
    - PRs can only be merged by the `Orchestrator_Agent` after all tests pass and the code review is approved.
