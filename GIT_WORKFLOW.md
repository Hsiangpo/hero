# Git Workflow Guide

1.  **Branching**:
    - All new features must be developed in a branch named `feature/TASK_ID-brief-description`.
    - Example: `feature/T123-implement-hero-levelup`.
2.  **Pull Requests (PRs)**:
    - Each task completion must be submitted as a PR to the `main` branch.
    - The PR description must link to the GDD specification.
    - PRs can only be merged by the `Orchestrator_Agent` after all tests pass and the code review is approved.
